# KIT Podcast Feeds

Flask server to create podcast feeds for KIT Opencast on demand.

Even tough the opencast software has a feature for RSS-Feeds the KIT has not activated this feature. Therefor you can run this flask server to provide a podcast feeds for you.

Feel free to host this, since I donâ€™t want to commit to this permanently. I provide this software for free use under MIT license. Note that this license of course does not apply obtained content.

Also feel free to create a PR fixing some of the open issues or adding new other features. I will do my best to respond to Pull Request quickly.
